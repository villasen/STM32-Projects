# STM32-Projects
Writing STM32 drivers for different ARM Cortex cores (M3, M4, M7). The drivers are written from scratch by starting projects on STM32CubeIDE as empty.
The drivers are GPIOs, SPI, I2C, USART/UART, TIMERs, CAN, PWM. 
The last goal of this project is to write a USB device driver with HID class support from scratch.
